\section*{Introduction}

The notes correspond to the master  
course \textbf{Associative Algebra} of the 
Vrije Universiteit Brussel, 
Faculty of Sciences, 
Department of Mathematics and Data Sciences. The course
is divided into twelve two-hour lectures. 

The content presented here draws heavily from \cite{MR3308118}, \cite{MR1449137}, 
and \cite{MR798076}. Additionally, I have 
followed the outstanding \href{https://ysharifi.wordpress.com}{blog} on 
abstract algebra by Yaghoub Sharif.

Prerequisites: An undergraduate ``abstract algebra'' course. See for example
my notes for the VUB courses \href{https://github.com/vendramin/group}{Group Theory}  and \href{https://github.com/vendramin/rings}{Rings and Module Theory}. 

The notes include many exercises. Mandatory exercises have a \colorbox{green!5!white}{green background}, while optional ones (bonus exercises) have a \colorbox{yellow!15!white}{yellow background}.

Thanks go to Ilaria Colazzo, 
Luca Descheemaeker, Lukas Simons.
