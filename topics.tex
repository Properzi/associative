\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{Some topics for final projects}

We collect here some topics for final presentations. Some topics
can also be used as bachelor or master theses. 

\subsection*{Rickart's theorem}

In Lecture \ref{09} we presented an algebraic proof of Rickart's theorem. 
The original proof uses analysis; see \cite[Chapter II, (6.4)]{MR1838439}. 

\subsection*{Connel's theorem}

In Lecture \ref{11} we presented the statement of Connel's theorem, which
characterizes prime group rings (see Theorem \ref{thm:Connel}). 
As a corollary, one obtains 
that the group ring $\C[G]$ is left artinian if and only if the group
$G$ is finite (see Corollary \ref{cor:Connel}). The proofs of these 
results appear for example in ...

\subsection*{Kolchin's theorem}

A matrix $a\in\GL_n(\C)$ is said to be \textbf{unipotent} 
if its characteristic polynomial is of the form $(X-1)^n$. 
A subgroup $G$ of $\GL_n(\C)$ is said to be \textbf{unipotent} if
each $g\in G$ is unipotent. 

Let $U_n(\C)$ be the subgroup of $\GL_n(\C)$ 
of matrices $(u_{ij})$ such that 
\[
u_{ij}=\begin{cases}
1&\text{if $i=j$},\\
0&\text{if $i>j$}.\end{cases}
\]

An important theorem of Kolchin states that 
every unipotent subgroup of $\GL_n(\C)$ is conjugate
of some subgroup of $U_n(\C)$. 
%The proof appears, for example, 
%here.
